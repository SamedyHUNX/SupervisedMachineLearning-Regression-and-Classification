Welcome to my **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification repository** repository! This repository contains resources, code examples, lab files, assignments, quiz, and practical implementations related to supervised machine learning.

## 🧠 About This Repository

Supervised machine learning is a fundamental concept in AI, enabling models to learn patterns from labeled datasets. In this repository, you will find:

- Folders divided into week,
- Code implementations for popular algorithms such as regression and classfication.
- Basic knowledges of ML, Gradient Descent, ML algorithms, solutions to assignments and more.
- Best practices for model evaluation, regularization, solutions to overfitting and underfitting.
